# nornir-tools

Ready to use tools and examples written with nornir.

The motivation behind this repo is mainly to share tools, examples and recipes to help you write your own tooling. However, some tooling might be simple and useful enough to work as is. Most of the examples under "tooling" should fit under that category.

Feel free to use, copy and modify according to your needs.

NOTE: Examples and tools in this repo are written with python3.6 and won't work on earlier versions.
